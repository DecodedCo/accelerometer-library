# accelerometer-library
Library to abstract away motion detection for Arduino + Accelerometer

## Prerequisites

1. Arduino
2. An accelerometer providing x,y,z acceleration data

## Implementation

This code was written using the Sparkfun Breakout for the **ADXL345**: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9836.

Starter Arduino code: https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/240

In the Arduino editor, load `differentiator.ino` and open up the `loop` tab to access the loop that processes the data loaded in.
